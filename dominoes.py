Solution for the dominoes problem from The Guardian, 15th Jun 2020.

The
[problem](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jun/15/can-you-solve-it-domino-dancing#comment-141590528)
is:

> Is it possible to cover an 8x8 chessboard with 32 dominos (which are each a
> 1x2 block) in such a way that any line parallel to a side of the chessboard
> always passes through the interior of at least one of the dominoes?

> If it is possible, draw an example. If it isnâ€™t, prove it.
